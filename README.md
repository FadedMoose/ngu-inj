# ngu-inj
Powershell & batch script to launch NGU Idle through Steam &amp; rvazarkar's NGU Injector at the same time.
Either one works by itself, I simply rewrote it to work in either language to see if I could.
The .cmd is the Powershell script.
Make sure you've only got one copy of the injector's 3.4.2_DOWNLOADME folder around, or it'll crash.
